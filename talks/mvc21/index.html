<ul style="display: block; padding-top: 30px;">
    <li ><defs>1,963,409</defs> users were classified for <defs>location</defs> and <b>determined to come from the UK, Ireland or the Isle of Man</b>: each user is associated with a latitude-longitude pair corresponding to an individual lowest-level place in the ONS 'Index of Place Names' (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) or a townland in the Ordnance Survey of Ireland (Republic of Ireland). 
     <ul><li><defs>mentions</defs> of low-level places (‘Cambridge’, ‘Ballymaguigan’) and regions, both formally- and informally-defined (‘Herefordshire’; ‘the North’; ‘Norn Iron’), weighted by number of occurrences, context, and distance between the places mentioned, in <defs>user location field, bio, or tweet text</defs></li>
<li><defs>interaction</defs> with a set of ‘official’ accounts manually determined to correspond to specific local areas (local government and services — police, fire, county and city councils, health authorities, and school boards). </li>

<li><i>fine</i> age categories ('I'm in my 40s', 'I'm a 90s kid')</li>
<li><i>broad</i> age categories (scored based on a dictionary of keywords — ‘retired’, ‘dad of three’, ’college student’, ‘Fortnite’ ...). </li>
</ul>
<li>Differences in the distribution of informativeness across different age groups.</li>
<ul><li> Users who specified actual ages or birthyears were disproportionately the youngest users; users binned into the middle category were disproportionately those who gave keywords <i>not</i> associated with the youngest group (generally occupational or familial), but no further information with which to narrow down. </li></ul>

<ul><li class='fragment'>Twitter data allows us to begin to understand varieties that are relatively under-represented in the sociolinguistic literature, eg. West Midlands.  
</li>
<li class='fragment'>Certain features may characterise a <defs>generalised ‘urban British English‘</defs>, rather than a more geographically-bounded variety like Multicultural London English. For this (short!) talk:</li><ul>

         <h3>Preposition drop</h3>
         <ul><li>The presence of constructions with <defs>no overt preposition</defs> where ‘standard’ varieties of English would have ’to’ has been reported for several different varieties of English.</li>
         <longexample><examples><b>Lancashire</b>.</examples> Today I’m going the library. <citation>(Myler 2011, 2013; Biggs 2014)</citation><br>
         <examples><b>Liverpool</b>.</examples> Swim the end and back. <citation>(Biggs 2014)</citation><br>
         <examples><b>Manchester</b>.</examples> She went the pub. <citation>(Haddican 2010)</citation><br>
         <examples><b>London, Kent</b>.</examples> I haven't been Shoreditch in ages. <citation>(Bailey 2018, Hall 2019)</citation></longexample>
<li class='fragment'>These different dialects seem to correspond to syntactic differences.</li>
<ul class='fragment'><li >In the <defs>south-east</defs> <citation>(Bailey 2018, Hall 2019)</citation>:</li>
<ul>
<li >the determiner is absent (<i>go pub</i>, but not <i>go the pub</i>);</li>
<li > the verb must be directional <i>go</i> or <i>come</i>;</li>
<li >modification (<i><defs><i>straight</i></defs> the pub, <defs><i>right</i></defs> the pub</i>) is impossible.</li>

<li class='fragment'>In the <defs>north-west</defs>:</li>

<li >the determiner is <defs>present</defs>: <i>I'm going the pub</i> <citation>(Haddican 2010</citation>, <i>John came the pub with me</i> <citation>(Biggs 2014)</citation>;</li>
<li >a wider range of verbs (<i>come, go, run, drive, nip, jog</i>) is available in Lancashire <citation>(Myler 2011)</citation>, and wider still in Liverpool (<i>Joe plodded the pub</i>; <i>swim the end and back</i>; <citation>Biggs 2014</citation>). </li>
<li >modification (<i><defs><i>straight</i></defs> the pub, <defs><i>right</i></defs> the pub</i>) is impossible in Lancashire <citation>(Myler 2011)</citation> but possible in Liverpool <citation>(Biggs 2014)</citation>.</li>

         <h3>Preposition drop</h3>
<ul>
<li class='fragment'>This rather disjoint picture of the overall <defs>geographical distribution</defs> of preposition deletion in British English corresponds both to descriptive gaps in the literature, and to variation in the extent to which this feature is considered regionally or sociolinguistically particular: </li>
<ul><blockquote class='fragment'>Bare NPs after GO are heard in young people’s informal English, whether or not they are speakers of the multiethnolect, but they are far more frequent in the multiethnolect [Multicultural London English]. <citation>(Cheshire, Nortier & Adger 2015: 11)</citation></blockquote>
<li class='fragment'>Described as a feature of the speech of “<i>a subset of English speakers in London (and some surrounding areas)</i>” by <citation>Hall (2019)</citation>, who treats the London pattern as a different phenomenon to that reported for varieties in the UK;</li>
<li class='fragment'><citation>Bailey (2016, 2018)</citation>: preposition drop occurs in ‘<i>southeast English</i>’, noting that this is deliberately vague and the boundaries are unknown.</li></ul>
<li class='fragment'>Should we take the existing data to reflect a high degree of interspeaker variation within preposition-drop varieties, or more systematic regional variation?</li>

<ul style="display: block; padding-top: 30px;">
    <li >We searched the corpus for all forms of the verbs <i>go, come, walk, head, return, drive, travel, fly, rush, swim</i>, returning <defs>761,361</defs> posts by 505,580 unique users. Of these, we could associate <citation>location metadata</citation> with <defs>597,945</defs> tweets posted by <defs>306,100</defs> unique users, and <citation>age metadata</citation> with <defs>178,604</defs> posts by <defs>45,307</defs> users. 
<li >What we seem to be able to add to the existing literature is the missing data about geographically-intermediate regions: across all contexts, preposition drop is found at the <defs>highest rates</defs> in our data in the West Midlands, with a clear, spatially-contiguous region running from Liverpool to London distinguished from the surrounding area by high rates of preposition deletion.</li><ul><li >A secondary zone of innovation in the South-West.</li></ul>

 <h3>Preposition drop: <b>our data</b></h3>

        <ul>

 <h3>Further thoughts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hopefully we've demonstrated that this corpus works — and allows us to fill in gaps in the existing data. </li>
    <li>We don't envisage that this kind of study <i>replaces</i> traditional sociolinguistic studies, but it has strengths in allowing us to get the kind of large-scale geographical picture that it's difficult to achieve with interview data.</li>
<li>We think it's possible that these data (and more) support the proposals of <citation>Drummond (2017)</citation>, among others — that many innovative features are shared between urban centres across 
    <li>And it seems to be possible to infer something about apparent time from Twitter data!</li>
